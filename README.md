# HBnB Evolution

## Project Description

HBnB Evolution is a simplified AirBnB-like application designed to demonstrate software architecture principles, object-oriented programming, and API-driven development.

This project is divided into multiple parts, each focusing on a specific phase of the application lifecycle, from architectural design to implementation and persistence.

The goal of HBnB Evolution is to progressively build a clean, maintainable, and scalable backend system by following best practices in software engineering.

---

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Design a well-structured backend architecture
- Apply object-oriented design principles
- Use UML diagrams to document system design
- Implement a layered architecture
- Develop a RESTful API
- Manage data persistence effectively

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized into four main parts:

holbertonschool-hbnb/
├── README.md
├── part1/
├── part2/
├── part3/
└── part4/


Each part represents a key stage in the evolution of the HBnB application.

## Part 1: Technical Documentation

### Description
Part 1 focuses on designing the architecture and documenting the system before any implementation.

### Key Topics
- Layered architecture
- Facade design pattern
- UML diagrams:
  - High-level package diagram
  - Class diagram (Business Logic Layer)
  - Sequence diagrams

### Outcome
A complete technical documentation that serves as a blueprint for the development phases.
